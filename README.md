* Run the build task in *.vscode/tasks.json* to do continuous TypeScript to JavaScript compilation.
* Edit code in the *source/* directory, and leave the code in *bin/* untouched.
* To get access to logs, connect to the FTP location which can be found in **Settings > Properties** of the Azure portal.
